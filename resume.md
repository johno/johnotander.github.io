I'm a software craftsman with experience in all facets of web application development. Significant expertise in web/mobile design and user experience by creating aesthetically pleasing user interfaces and intuitive interactions. Skilled at developing modern, RESTful applications with data analytics, 3rd-party API integration, and efficient database queries.

My primary emphasis is the front end, where I write performant, reusable CSS/Javascript and design interfaces that are easy, and a delight, to use. I'm passionate about automation, and invest time in automating tasks with Gulp, Yeoman, and other tools.
