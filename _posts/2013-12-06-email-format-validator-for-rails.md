title: Email Format Validator for Rails
summary: Validate urls and format them with an all-inclusive gem.
category: Ruby Gems

I made a gem called Email Format that utilizes the `validate_each` method that's included in `ActiveModel::Validations`. It uses the [email_regex](https://github.com/dougwig/email_regex) gem written by Doug Wiegley which "provides a valid email regex that conforms to most valid RFC edges cases (disallows backticks), and allows for a few illegal patterns that are in common use".

The validator itself is very simple, it simply compares the attribute in question to the `EmailRegex::EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX` like so:

    class EmailFormatValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
      def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
        unless value =~ EmailRegex::EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX
          record.errors[attribute] << (options[:message] || "is invalid")
        end
      end
    end

So, you can now do the following to validate your email attributes:

    require 'email_format'
    
    class Awesome
      include ActiveModel::Validations
     
      attr_accessor :email
      
      validates :email, email_format: true
     end
     
     awesome = Awesome.new

     awesome.email = "valid@email.com"
     awesome.valid? # => true

     awesome.email = "invalid_email"
     awesome.valid? # => false
