title: Validating Presence with Nested Attributes in Ruby on Rails
summary: The standard validates_presence_of keyword doesn't play nicely with nested attributes, however inverse_of does. 
category: Rails

More often than not, developers typically want to ensure the presence of the parent model when accepting nested attributes for the dependent model.  This can normally be validated with the simple class below:

    class Tree < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :forest
      attr_accessible :common_name, :forest_id, :scientific_name
  
      validates_presence_of :forest
      validates_presence_of :common_name
      validates_presence_of :scientific_name
    end


However, the order that `accepts_nested_attributes_for` validates and saves the Forest and Tree models will cause the `validates_presence_of :forest` to fail.  This occurs because the Forest is saved after the Tree, so there isn't the presence of the `forest_id` attribute yet, since the Forest hasn't yet been created. However, this same presence validation can be expressed in a slightly different way, with `inverse_of` which will play nicely with nested attributes.

Below the `inverse_of` is implemented with a `has_many`/`belongs_to` relationship where the Forest model `accepts_nested_attributes_for` the Tree model:
 
    class Tree < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :forest, inverse_of: :trees
      attr_accessible :common_name, :forest_id, :scientific_name
  
      validates_presence_of :common_name
      validates_presence_of :scientific_name
    end

And the Forest model that accepts the nested attributes for Tree:

    class Forest < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :trees
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :trees, inverse_of: :forest, allow_destroy: true
      attr_accessible :trees_attributes
  
      attr_accessible :climate, :latitude, :longitude, :name, :size
  
      validates_presence_of :name
      validates_presence_of :size
      validates_presence_of :climate
      validates_presence_of :latitude
      validates_presence_of :longitude
    end

Now you have the same `validates_presence_of` validation which plays nicely with `accepts_nested_attributes_for`.  The reason the `inverse_of` works is because it tells Rails to automatically create the associated join models when the records are saved.  Also, the `inverse_of` specification helps Rails to optimize in-memory associations, which will result in better performance for your app.  Without it, Rails will actually load a second copy of the Tree, if it's already in memory, when you perform an operation like `@forest.trees.first`.

Another important thing to note is that `inverse_of` doesn't work with `:through` and `:polymorphic` associations.
