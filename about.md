I'm a web developer and designer living in Boise, Idaho.   

I don't like to limit myself to developing with particular tools, but I'm most experienced with Ruby on Rails, Sass, and Coffeescript. Though, I'm never deterred by vanilla CSS or Javascript. I've recently started learning Ember.

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Boise State University, and only have a few part-time semesters left. I have a B.A. in Hispanic Studies.

I work at [Uceem](https://uceem.com) and co-founded [Margin](http://margin.io).

I also like skiing... _A lot_.
