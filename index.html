          <h3><a href="http://pixyll.com">Pixyll</a></h3>
          <p>
            Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than
            aesthetic fluff. It’s mobile <em>first</em>, fluidly responsive, and delightfully
            lightweight. It’s pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast
            to make a statement, on all devices.

          <p>
            Grayscale is a color palette for prototyping the web. It consists of three gray
            color series with Sass variables and corresponding CSS classes, allowing one to
            try out different grays while prototyping with the switch of a variable.

          <p>
            Urls for Humans is a gem that allows you to apply meaningful names to your Rails
            application's urls by leveraging what happens under the covers with the
            <code>to_param</code> and <code>to_i</code> methods. It's an extremely lightweight
            alternative to already existing solutions.

          <p>
            This Ember CLI Gravatar addon is an Ember component for gravatar image tags.
            It integrates with ember-cli, and has computed property binding, so it changes when
            the underlying email changes, as well.

          <p class="small muted">Currently under development.</p>
          <p>
            Furtive is a forward-thinking, lightweight CSS micro-framework. It's truly mobile-first. Meaning, 
            all media queries are done by larger viewports. This cuts back on the processing necessary for 
            mobile devices. It also has a small footprint, cutting down on the bandwidth necessary for 
            downloading CSS. Furtive is intended to be just that, furtive. Minimal by design.

          <p>
            Lumber.js is a wrapper for the d3.js library. It comes with numerous graphs out of
            the box, and only requires you to write a touch of javascript. It leverages HTML5
            data attributes to parse the graph's data and relevant information like color
            schemes and axis labels.
